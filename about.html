<!--<p class="w3-margin-left w3-text-white w3-xlarge customfont" style="text-align:justify;margin-right:128px;">My name is N8Programs, and I love programming. I mostly create projects involving artificial intelligence of some sort or another, though I've made many games and applications in my past, some of which are showcased here. If you want to see a full gallery
    of my various exploits check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/N8python">Github Page</a>, and I have documented some of my coolest projects on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiD7KqDgRN0rX0yU3J0PLw?view_as=subscriber">Youtube Channel</a>. I make new stuff now and then,
    but don't expect any consistent release schedules. Now that you read a full paragraph of backstory, go check out some of the projects I've posted on this website!

    Hi - I'm N8Programs, and I love programming. I have created a variety of projects, tech demos, and games, involving computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and other exciting topics. I post many of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/N8python">Github</a>,
    where I've pinned some of my most notable ones. When I'm not programming, I enjoy chatting with friends online, reading, and math. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!
